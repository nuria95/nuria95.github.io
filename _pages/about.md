Hi! I am Núria.
I am a PhD candidate at ETH Zurich in the [Computational Robotics Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich and a CLS fellow. I am co-supervised by Prof. Stelian Coros at ETH and Prof. Georg Martius from the [Autonomous Learning group](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/distributed-intelligence/home/) at Univeristy of Tübingen. 
Before that, I achieved my MSc in Robotics, Systems and Control from ETH and I did my Master thesis at LAS group supervised by Prof. Andreas Krause.

My main focus is sequential decision making for robotics. I aim to develop algorithms that leverage diverse prior data to provide agents with the ability to efficiently explore new environments and autonomously learn about the complexities of the real world.
Apart from that, in my free time (if any) I love playing sports, reading and playing music.
